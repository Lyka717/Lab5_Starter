1) I do not think you would use unit testing for the "message" feature because it is likely to have many moving parts for a complex feature. And unit testing can not test how these parts affect each other.
2) You would use unit testing  to test the max messagee length because it does not invole too many moving parts as it only looks for the number of characters typed.
